                    <h3>Introducing your product.</h3>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Ben and I from Commputer75 technology services. It’s great to meet you. I’m not sure if you’ve heard of us, but
                    we have done extensive business with Trinity and F-Society. We have found great success with these clients and I am here
                    looking to help other businesses. Our products have helped cut costs by 15 percent, since they are built to
                    use less electricity and have longer lifespans. Unlike other products put out by our competitors, ours do not have to be
                    replaced, which cuts down on unnecessary costs. We also have a staff of experts at the ready for any necessary repairs
                    or tech support your office may need in the future. By integrating our products into your current setup, your company
                    will run at a smoother rate. We are giving a talk on this tomorrow at 2:30 pm in the convention hall and I am inviting
                    company leaders to the presentation. Here is the schedule and a list of the products we will be presenting. I look
                    forward to seeing you there
                    </p>
